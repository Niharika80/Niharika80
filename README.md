## Projects

### 1. Malware Analysis Home Lab
🔗 (https://github.com/Niharika80/My-Home-Lab)

- Simulated execution of a **known malicious payload** in a controlled environment to generate endpoint telemetry  
- Collected detailed **process, network, and file activity** using **Sysmon**  
- Forwarded endpoint logs to **Splunk SIEM** for centralized monitoring and analysis  
- Investigated suspicious behaviors such as abnormal process execution and unexpected outbound network connections  

### 2. pfSense Firewall Lab
🔗 https://github.com/Niharika80/pfSense-Firewall-Lab

- Deployed a **pfSense firewall** in VirtualBox with isolated **WAN and LAN** segments  
- Simulated malicious network traffic from **Kali Linux (WAN)** targeting a **Windows 10 host (LAN)**  
- Analyzed abnormal traffic patterns using **Wireshark**  
- Mitigated the attack using **pfSense firewall rules** and validated results through firewall logs

### 3. Active Directory Project
🔗 https://github.com/Niharika80/Active-Directory-Project-

- Deployed a **Windows Active Directory environment** and centralized **Windows Security logs** into **Splunk SIEM**  
- Simulated an **RDP brute-force authentication attack** from Kali Linux and analyzed logon events to identify suspicious activity  
- Used **Atomic Red Team** to emulate **local account creation (MITRE ATT&CK T1136.001)** and monitored the behavior through Splunk  
- Implemented **Group Policy controls** to restrict command prompt access and validated policy enforcement through system behavior and logs
